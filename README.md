# Predicting Severe Cases of COVID-19

For the machine learning sub-module we were given a dataset containing epidemiological data from the COVID-19 outbreak. We had to define a problem we wanted to solve using the given dataset and develop 3 sophisticated machine learning algorithms to solve the problem.
For this assignment I trained three classifiers to identify severe cases of COVID-19. You can read my findings in `report.pdf` or try it yourself in Colab.
